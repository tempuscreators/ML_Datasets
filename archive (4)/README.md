# Monthly Top 50 Social Media Accounts Dataset

This project aims to scrape data from Wikipedia pages to retrieve the top 50 accounts or channels on various social media platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter. The scraped data is then processed and saved as CSV files. The dataset is updated monthly, providing the latest rankings and information on the most followed social media accounts.

## Scraping Process

The scraping process is implemented using Python and the following libraries:

- `requests`: Used for sending HTTP requests to the Wikipedia pages.
- `BeautifulSoup`: Used for parsing the HTML content and extracting data from the tables.
- `pandas`: Used for processing and organizing the scraped data.

The script retrieves the data by sending HTTP requests to the Wikipedia pages and parsing the HTML content using BeautifulSoup. The relevant information, such as usernames, followers, descriptions, and other platform-specific details, is extracted from the tables. The scraped data is then processed and saved as CSV files for further analysis and exploration.


## Directory Structure

The repository follows a monthly directory structure to organize the data. Each month, a new directory is created with the format `YYYY-MM` (e.g., `2023-07` for July 2023). Inside each monthly directory, you will find the CSV files containing the data for that specific month.
